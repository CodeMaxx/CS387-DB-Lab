I haven't used the .jar file.

Put the .java(src) and index.html(Webcontent) in the appropriate location.

Use the create.sql file to create tables and populate them.
I also have some drop table statements at the top which shouldn't hurt.

The Login.java has the connection details, port no., username etc. Please edit it according to need.

Run server.

index.html has a login link.

Login using id: '0001'   password: '0001'
(works similarly for 0001 through 0007)

It will already show posts from followers.

To see posts from specific ID, use the search box.

Home button brings back the follow posts.

Use the Add Post button to write a post. Use the box to write it. Then click on publish. A popup will tell you if the post has been done successfully. You'll come back to whichever posts you were looking at before.

More button will be there at the end of the page if there are more posts.
Similarly if there are more than 3 comments there'll be a more button.
Clicking them will display 10 new posts or rest of the comments respectively.

There is a Following button which can be used to see who you are following. You can also unfollow with the X button as according to the specification.

Use the logout link at the bottom of the page to sign out.
